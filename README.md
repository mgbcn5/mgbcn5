 Hello all!!!!

 My name is Meg and I am a girl currently attending SAIT for UEX Design. My goal is to hopefully become a product designer at a top company where I can show my skills to the world and make a difference. I hope I can look back at my GitHub profile in 5 years and be proud of what I accomplished in this field.

##Web Communication
The course that will be primarily featured here that I am enrolled in is Web Communications.
I will be learning about how to become confident in developing web pages and will be going in-depth about all of the languages and scripting skills needed to get a website working properly.

## WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
##VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

I am hoping to have future projects that I build here to showcase my current skills and capabilities. 


 Thank you all of you for taking the time to read this and learn a bit about my profile. I hope we all grow together in our fields and become what we always dreamed to be. 

 :)))
